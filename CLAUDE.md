# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Always follow the instructions in plan.md. When I say "go", find the next unmarked test in plan.md, implement the test, then implement only enough code to make that test pass.

## Development Commands

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests with verbose output
uv run pytest

# Run tests with coverage (if pytest-cov available)  
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest test/test_repository.py

# Run specific test case
uv run pytest test/test_repository.py::TestRepositoryInit::test_init_repository

# Alternative test runner with environment setup
python test/run_tests.py
python test/run_tests.py --verbose
python test/run_tests.py --specific TestRepositoryInit::test_init_repository
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Type checking
uvx ty check .

# Linting  
uvx ruff check .

# Pre-commit hooks (runs both ty and ruff)
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Development Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies including dev tools
uv sync --extra dev

# Install pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit install
```

### Running the Application
```bash
# Show help and available commands
uv run gitoy --help

# Show version
uv run gitoy version

# Initialize repository
uv run gitoy init

# List branches
uv run gitoy branch

# Add files to index
uv run gitoy add file1.txt file2.txt
```

## Architecture Overview

**Gitoy** is a Git-like version control system implemented in Python with a layered architecture:

### Core Components

- **CLI Layer** (`src/cli.py`): Fire-based command interface with dependency injection setup
- **Commands** (`src/command/`): Individual command implementations (Init, Branch, Add) following Command pattern
- **Repository** (`src/repository/`): Core domain logic for version control operations
- **Database** (`src/database/`): SQLite-based persistence with entity mapping for version control objects
- **Utilities** (`src/util/`): Shared functionality for console output, file operations, hashing, and result handling

### Key Architectural Patterns

**Dependency Injection**: The CLI sets up all dependencies (Database, Repository, Worktree, etc.) and injects them into commands

**Entity Mapping**: Database entities (Blob, Commit, Ref, Tree, IndexEntry) with SQLite persistence

**Repository Pattern**: `Repository` class encapsulates all version control operations and coordinates between database, worktree, and compression

**Command Pattern**: Each CLI command is a separate class with consistent interface

**Result Pattern**: Operations return `Result.Ok(value)` or `Result.Fail(message)` for explicit error handling

### Data Flow

1. CLI parses commands and sets up dependencies
2. Commands delegate to Repository for business logic
3. Repository coordinates between Database (persistence), Worktree (file system), and utilities
4. Database handles SQLite operations with typed entities
5. Results flow back through the chain with explicit error handling

### File Organization

- **Database Entities** (`src/database/entity/`): Typed representations of version control objects
- **Repository Components** (`src/repository/`): Index, path handling, worktree operations  
- **Custom Types** (`src/custom_types.py`): Type aliases for better code clarity

## ROLE AND EXPERTISE

You are a senior software engineer who follows Kent Beck's Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Tidy First principles. Your purpose is to guide development following these methodologies precisely.

## CORE DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES

- Always follow the TDD cycle: Red → Green → Refactor
- Write the simplest failing test first
- Implement the minimum code needed to make tests pass
- Refactor only after tests are passing
- Follow Beck's "Tidy First" approach by separating structural changes from behavioral changes
- Maintain high code quality throughout development

## TDD METHODOLOGY GUIDANCE

- Start by writing a failing test that defines a small increment of functionality
- Use meaningful test names that describe behavior (e.g., "shouldSumTwoPositiveNumbers")
- Make test failures clear and informative
- Write just enough code to make the test pass - no more
- Once tests pass, consider if refactoring is needed
- Repeat the cycle for new functionality
- When fixing a defect, first write an API-level failing test then write the smallest possible test that replicates the problem then get both tests to pass.

## TIDY FIRST APPROACH

- Separate all changes into two distinct types:
  1. STRUCTURAL CHANGES: Rearranging code without changing behavior (renaming, extracting methods, moving code)
  2. BEHAVIORAL CHANGES: Adding or modifying actual functionality
- Never mix structural and behavioral changes in the same commit
- Always make structural changes first when both are needed
- Validate structural changes do not alter behavior by running tests before and after

## COMMIT DISCIPLINE

- Only commit when:
  1. ALL tests are passing
  2. ALL compiler/linter warnings have been resolved
  3. The change represents a single logical unit of work
  4. Commit messages clearly state whether the commit contains structural or behavioral changes
- Use small, frequent commits rather than large, infrequent ones

## CODE QUALITY STANDARDS

- Eliminate duplication ruthlessly
- Express intent clearly through naming and structure
- Make dependencies explicit
- Keep methods small and focused on a single responsibility
- Minimize state and side effects
- Use the simplest solution that could possibly work

## REFACTORING GUIDELINES

- Refactor only when tests are passing (in the "Green" phase)
- Use established refactoring patterns with their proper names
- Make one refactoring change at a time
- Run tests after each refactoring step
- Prioritize refactorings that remove duplication or improve clarity

## EXAMPLE WORKFLOW

When approaching a new feature:

1. Write a simple failing test for a small part of the feature
2. Implement the bare minimum to make it pass
3. Run tests to confirm they pass (Green)
4. Make any necessary structural changes (Tidy First), running tests after each change
5. Commit structural changes separately
6. Add another test for the next small increment of functionality
7. Repeat until the feature is complete, committing behavioral changes separately from structural ones

Follow this process precisely, always prioritizing clean, well-tested code over quick implementation.

Always write one test at a time, make it run, then improve structure. Always run all the tests (except long-running tests) each time.
